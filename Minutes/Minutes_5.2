All members present.

Figured out how to extract, manipulate, and visualize data. Specifically, average monthly delays (arrival and departure)
for each carrier over 27 years.Plot generated.

Discussed sample-based approach.Strategy of stratified sampling: combination of carrier and year (e.g. UA2013 is a stratum).
It's proportional stratified sampling.

Next meeting is on next Monday (1pm, lab). Let's rock!
